# TODO: Also implement pixel2ray for PinHole

# MORE IDEAS:
# - Something like CoordinateTransformations' transform_deriv / transform_deriv_params, will be useful for estimators
# - Could a camera model BE a CoordinateTransformations.Transform ?
# - In doubt if pixel2ray/point2pixel should return a transform or DO the transform... The former will lead to ugly code, I find...
# - I don't like the Ray struct... For many users, all rays will have zero origin anyways. I'm in accurate underwater and 360 business,
#   where the shift of the origin matters. I'll be extending this later with some very exotic camera models, which will need something
#   like this. Needs some more thought... 
#   --> Maybe a pixel2rayorigin, which defaults to calling to the "simple" pixel2ray and adding a default zero origin. When you do the
#       accurate stuff, you would call pixel2rayorigin rather then pixel2ray. And only the funky models would have to implement it.
